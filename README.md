# GoPY-Board-Game
GoPy Board is similar board games like Gomoku, Yonmoku etc.

I implemented a simplified ”GoPy Board” game using Python programming language and to get familiar with control flows, collections and functions. 
The software that I implemented is fulfilling some basic operations that are included in similar board games like Gomoku, Yonmoku etc.
